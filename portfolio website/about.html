          <h2>My story</h2>
          <p>
            From Luxembourg. ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡º
            Currently in Cambridge.ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Hello!
            After working in the animation and advertisement industry for almost a decade, I recently decided to channel my storytelling, analytical as well as quick creative problem solving skills into helping real people with real problems to
            design meaningful experiences which transcend the silver screen.
            Storyboarding and UX have a lot in common. Both disciplines thrive on understanding the needs and problems of others from all possible angles, seeing the world through their eyes and combining everything in coherent products to inspire,
            motivate and bring about enjoyable, captivating experiences for everyone to enjoy.
            I want to be part of a company which follows a user-centric approach to leave a positive mark however, big or small, on people's lives and to keep developing the many new skills I have acquired during my UX course ranging from UX to UI
            over to front-end development, in a collaborative, inspiring environment.
            When not drawing or designing I like to roam the streets of Cambridge to immersive myself in all it has to offer, hoping secretly to find problems that need solving.
            I am currently available for full- and part-time positions in the Cambridge and London area or for remote work.
