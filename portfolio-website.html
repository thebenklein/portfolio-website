      <h9>Overview</h9>
      <p>The main objective of my Frontend Development for Designers specialization course was to build a responsive portfolio from scratch using Html, Css and Javascript in order to present my UX| UI case studies in the best light possible and to
        pick up some coding skills along the way.</p>

      <h10>Context and Challenges</h10><br>

      <h9> Timeline </h9>
      <p> 08 December 2021- 31 January 2022</p>

      <h9>The Problem</h9>
      <p>Since a portfolio not only represents your work but also who you are as a designer, its is key to making that ever-important initial good impression on potential future employers. I therefore wanted to learn how to create my own site
        starting from the ground up in order to stand out among pre-made web portfolios.
        At the same time, I wanted to learn how to use Html, Css and Javascript and to be able to communicate with and relate to frontend developers down the road in my future career and become a more well-rounded UX|UI Designer.</p>
      <h9>Goals</h9>
      <p>My main goals are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To create a responsive website to display my case studies in the best light possible across all devices</li>
        <li>To use the website itself to showcase my coding skills</li>
      </ul>

      <h10>Process & Insights</h10><br>
      <h9>Laying the groundwork: Html</h9>
      <p>
        Since we were provided with the wireframes defining the overall design of the website, I focused my initial attention on thinking about what layout I wanted to use for my Case Studies and my ‘About’ page.
      </p>
      <p>Once I had a clear idea of what I wanted those to look like, I started gathering all the files I needed to put them together. </p>
      <p>
        First I wrote down all the written content and then moved on to collect the visual documents, which I kept two copies off: one 1200px wide and one 600px wide in order to be displayed best across all screen sizes without compromising the
        loading time.
      </p>
      <p>Once I had all my website copy, I started building the structure of my site using Html, including a footer containing my contact information, a Header, and a Main.</p>
      <p>Once that was all done, I moved on to add some style to the site.</p>

      <h9>Styling with Css</h9>

      <p>Now that I had all material in place, it was time to make it look more appealing.
        In comes CSS.<br>

        Based on the mobile first approach and making good use of the Web-inspector, I first addressed the overall layout of the landing as well as ‘About’ page by adding columns using a CSS grid layout.<br>

        To order to make my website responsive, I implemented media queries for small, middle, and large screens defining what the changes will happen when the site is viewed on different screens.<br>

        Once that was done I added several buttons with different states - hover, active and visited for the main CTAs on my site.<br>

        I then proceeded to adjust the font type and color of the text as well as of the headers to make my site easier to read and skim over. <br>

        Once the bulk of the site was designed and looked well, I added an illustration to the hero section of my page to welcome the viewer and to add a face to my website and validated my choice with several A/B tests.
        Not only did it make my site more friendly, but it also make it more memorable.<br>

        Once I was happy with my styling, I proceeded to add some interactivity to the site.<br>

      <h9>Javascript</h9>

      <p>Using Javascript for the very first time, I added a hamburger menu to the mobile version of my site to make better use of the small real estate of mobile screens.<br>

        While Html and Css was quite easy to wrap my head around, learning about variables, data types, functions, conditionals, and loops in Javascript was a steep learning curve to say the least. But I am glad I learned it since the possibilities,
        while still limited, are definitely substantial.<br>

        Once my site was done, it was time to see that it could hold its own in the real-world.<br>

      </p>

      <h9>User Testing</h9>

      <p>After putting together a test scrip, coming up with scenarios and defining the criteria by which I selected my volunteers, I set out to conduct 5 remote moderated Usability tests. Since my portfolio will be viewed by Hiring Managers and
        recruiters most, I paid close attention to selecting tech-savvy individuals with current or previous hiring experience in order to recreate the scenario in which my site must perform best.<br>

        Although the tests went very well , there were some minor issues, which for the most part were of low severity. The biggest issue that came up was that the project summaries were not worded clearly enough.<br>

        After addressing the problems, it was time to polish my code and make sure it was of industry quality.</p>


      <h9>Code Quality</h9>

      <p>
        With the help of Atom Beautify ,and several Linters such as W3C , Linter-Stylelint, and Standard Javascript style I set out to clear my code of any errors that had crept in. <br>

        While some of them were quite straight forward, some requested some in-depth online research to fix them.<br>

        Once they were all gone, I set out to make sure that my site would be displayed as I wanted it to across all browsers.</p>

      <h9>Cross-Browser Testing </h9>
      <p>Using Browserstack I tested my site across several browser such as Edge, Safari, Firefox and Chrome as well as for Ipad and Iphone. I wanted to make sure that all my work would be viewed in its best shape possible and that no compatibility
        problem would cause trouble.<br>

        Gladly everything went well and no issues came up.<br>

        In order to assure that users with visual impairments will also be able to enjoy my website to its fullest, I ran a quick Color Check which all went well.</p>

        <h9>Learnings</h9>

      <p>When I first started this specialization course I had never even dabbled with coding and looking back and what I have created within a little bit over a month, I am very proud of the end-result. <br>

        Although it is a basic site compared to what is out there, Rome wasn’t build in a day either and it does present my case studies in the best light thus far and is in and of itself a display of my skills and willingness to learn and grow as a
        Designer. <br>

        Last but definitely not least it also displays the value of good mentorship and the value of a good community. Without the constant feedback and help from my mentor this experience would have been much less enjoyable.<br>

        Thank you for your time!</p>
