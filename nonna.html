      <h1>The Challenge</h1>
      <p>As part of my CF course my first ever UX project was to design a health and well-being portal that helps people leading high-pressure lives to reduce their stress level in order to prevent burnout.

      <h1>Understand The User</h1>

      <h2>Surveys & Interviews</h2>
      <p>I started by defining my target audience for "stressed out, always on people". A lot of my close friends recently became parents, so I decided that career women with children or family represented this category best, since they are literally
        always "on". To gain some initial insights I put together a survey before meeting up with several of my users to conduct some in-depth interviews.
        After using an affinity map to organize all my research data, the 4 main insights which caught my eye were:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>They prefer holistic ways to stay balanced</li>
        <li> They dislike too much technology</li>
        <li>Coming up with and cooking healthy, satisfying meals for the entire family on a daily basis causes major stress</li>
        <li>Grocery shopping is a major painpoint</li>
      </ol>

      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/nonna/website_affinitymapInterviews@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/nonna/website_affinitymapInterviews@2x.png" alt="value proposition">
      </picture>

      <p>I realized that cooking for themselves and their family was a core, overarching issue that caused much stress on many levels. Without a proper diet their families were not happy, which in return made them feel bad, their self-image was
        suffering when gaining weight and their cognitive abilities were diminishing, making them moody and perform poorly at their job. So I decided to tackle this issue.</p>

      <h2> Problem Statement</h2>
      <p> " A career woman and head of the household needs an easy to use app to help her put together healthy daily meals for her family in a timely manner, respecting everyone's varying diets and staying within budget, so that she can focus on
        getting her job done without distractions during the day, and get her balancing family time and sleep at night.<br>We will know this to be true when we see career women with families download our app, use it frequently, and give positive
        feedback."

      <h2> Storyboards</h2>

      <p>To give some real-world context to my designs and to make the problem resonate with stakeholders more, I drew some storyboards to make them better understand the value proposition of our app.</p>

      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/nonna/nonna_storyboards@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/nonna/nonna_storyboards@2x.png" alt="value proposition">
      </picture>

      <h2>Competitive SWOT Analysis</h2>
      <p>Why was there no app out there that was helping my user effectively? With that question in mind I decided to do a SWOT analysis of the major competitors in the field of cooking apps to figure out what they were doing right, where they fell
        short, and where I could fit in the market. I knew that all of my interviewees were using cooking apps to varying degrees, so there had to be an issue.</p>

      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/nonna/website_nonnaswot@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/nonna/website_nonnaswot@2x.png" alt="swot analysis">
      </picture>
      <p>One of my main realization was that all these apps aimed at serving one user, allowing to save the eating habits, allergies, intolerances of one person only. So I made the following hypothesis:</p>

      <p>I believe that by building an app which allows the user to keep track of friends' and family's eating habits and preferences such as allergies, intolerances, diets, and medical conditions by creating individual profiles and to cook custom
        dishes by selecting those profiles, I will be able to fill a market gap with a unique selling proposition."</p>

      <p>During my research I also came across a barcode scanner which I decided to implement in my design to address the pain-point about grocery shopping my users had mentioned. Since this will be a collaboration with an existing company, I decided
        to leave it out of this case study in great detail.</p>

      <h2>Personas</h2>

      <p>Using the insights I had gained from my affinity and empathy maps I created two personas to put a relatable face to my research data. I picked Sara and Tanja to show that stress is very subjective. With 3 children, a job, and a husband, Sara
        is a poster girl for a woman constantly being on the verge of a burnout. While Tanja has less going on in her life, her more advanced age makes keeping up with technological advances more stressful while still trying to support her son and
        keep
        a long distance relationship. So while she might not seem like an always-on person, all these factors contribute greatly to her stress levels, with a tolerance that is less high.</p>

      <h2>User journeys</h2>

      <p>To understand my user even better and to unveil further insights and opportunities, I created some user journeys. While doing these journeys and really honing in at every step my users would have to take to accomplish their goal, I
        discovered
        a lot of opportunities which I hadn't seen from my POV. Some of the discoveries that emerged shaped the app in a major way. For instance the fact that Tanja hopes that there won't be much reading to do, transformed the scanner from text heavy
        slides to a single, color-coded screen. </p>

      <h2>Giving real life context to the app</h2>

      <p>To describe my users' experience using the app and to understand the circumstances and larger context in which the app will be used, I drew some more storyboards. </p>

      <p>Drawing out the process really helped me to understand of Sara's and Tanja's reality. When drawing Sara's boards for
        instance, I felt the extend of her stress much more and realized the importance of making the app as easily learnable as possible. In her state of mind, the slightest friction would result in her abandoning the app. This raised the bar for my
        future usability tests as well, which happened in much more relaxed settings. If a test subject would get frustrated, my target user would throw the phone across the room.</p>

      <h1>Define&Ideate</h1>
      <h2>UserFlows, Sitemaps & Card Sorting</h2>
      <p>After creating user flows for the main tasks I went on to figure out the informational hierarchy of my app.
        To get inspired and see how other apps structure their products, I did a content audit of several apps and then drew out my first sitemap. I tested my initial sitemap by running an open card sort exercise on OptimalSort, to see how my users
        would categorize and label the different categories. One major take-away was the importance of wording and speaking my user's language, which lead me to being less  'creative' with my titles, and more straight forward for clarity's sake. This
        also helped me a lot when I later on designed on Onboarding process. </p>

      <h1>Wireframes&Prototype</h1>

      <h2>Low-Fidelity & Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <p>With my IA in place, it was time to translate everything into visuals. My main objective was to figure out the flow with my low-fidelity wireframes for myself, to then polish those into a functional mid-fidelity prototype to be able to run
        usability tests and get feedback from my users. Since this was the first round of designs, I didn't try to overthink them but kept a list of Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability heuristics always near by for reference.</p>

      <h1>Test&Iterate</h1>
      <h2>Usability Tests, Affinity Maps & Rainbow Spreadsheets</h2>
      <p>It was time to test my assumptions. I decided to run 6 moderated remote usability tests using Adobe XD and Zoom to minimize the stress on my test subjects. After the tests I created an affinity map to categorize my findings and a Rainbow
        Spreadsheet to determine which problems needed to be addressed first. Here are some of the major issues that came up and the changes I made to rectify them.</p>
      <h2>Issue 1: Participants have trouble finding the cooking feature </h2>
      <p>Change made: I restructure the ‘Let’s Cook’ section and moved ‘Your Cookbook to the Homescreen, removing any possible confusions the user might encounter when using the cooking feature.</p>

      </picture>

      <h2>Issue 2: Problem locating profiles</h2>
      <p>Change made: I added a ‘My Profiles’ section to the main navigation menu, and merged the feature to save friends' and family’s medical conditions within the profile creation process, freeing up the setting section for technical aspects of
        the
        app only while centralizing all profile related information in an easy to find place.</p>

      </picture>

      <h2>Issue 3: Making sense of Scanner ingredient breakdown</h2>
      <p>In order to enable the user to understand the ingredient breakdown at one glance, I implemented one single color-coded screen reducing the swipes by 90%.</p>

    <div>
      <h1>Refine</h1>
      <h2>Gestalt and Design Principles, WCAG Guidelines, iOS Human Interface Guidelines, Design Language, A/B Tests, Peer Reviews & Animations</h2>
      <p>After having addressed all the functionality issues and testing it again on some friends with much better results, it was time to address the UI of my app. By studying and applying the Gestalt Principles, the Principles of Design, WCAG
        guidelines, and iOS Human Interface Guidelines I made Nonna visually more pleasing and easier to navigate for all users. When stuck or in doubt, I ran some A/B Tests or asked for feedback from my peers on Slack. I also implemented some
        animations during on the onboarding process to get rid of the static images and hook the user on a visceral level, leaving a long lasting impression. 
        Good UI can not save bad UX design, but it can definitely enhance it. 
        At this point I also decided to give my app a friendly face. Since my app was entitled Nonna, I figured a mascot in the shape of a friendly old Italian lady would be the right fit. Not only would it represent all the values I wanted my app to
        stand for, but also make the app more relatable and appealing. Here are a few sketches of early ideas and as well as the final design which I chose based on some guerilla preference testing.</p>

        <img src="img/nonna/Nonna_designs@2x.png" alt="high fid wires">
      </picture>

      <p>  Once I had made all the changes I put together a design language to assure consistency for further iterations and keep track of the many design decisions I had made throughout the design.</p>

      <p>And here is a selection of some high-fidelity wireframes!</p>

      <h2>Main take-aways and where is Nonna going from here</h2>
      <p>Since this was my first project working as a UX designer, the learning curve was extremely steep, but thanks to the Design Thinking Process I never got lost and learned a lot during this project. Some of the main take-aways definitely
        are to never build anything on assumptions, always empathize with the user, seeing problems through other people's eyes is extremely important and every minute spend on doing thorough research will save you a lot of time and effort later on.
        Good design depends on how well you understand your users, their problems, goals and realities. 
        As to where Nonna is going from here, some features to come are the articles section as well as a meal prep option. 
        Given the high amount of interest this projects has been getting due to its relevance with allergies and intolerances increasing, I will definitely pursue this project until it is released.</p>
      <h2>Thank you for your time 🙏🏻</h2>
