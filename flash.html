      <h6>The Challenge</h6>
      <p>To design a mobile app which empowers and motivates students to learn new vocabulary on the go during 5-10 minute sessions. The app has to provide the user with a way to add personalized definitions.
      </p>
      <h5> Background </h5>
      <p> Flash was my very first UX project which I was assigned during my CF Introduction course.</p>

      <p> At that point I had little to no knowledge as to how to create a user experience or of the tools used in the industry. Nonetheless I decided to give this my all and learn by making mistakes.
        <p />

      <p>While I was doing this project I was teaching in a high school in Luxembourg, Europe. Luxembourg, being among the smallest countries in the world, the language classes are very intense, expecting students to speak and write French, German,
        English and Luxembourgish. From talking to my colleagues, who have been teaching languages for years, I knew that it was becoming harder and harder to teach the traditional way due to the students' ever shrinking attention spans and the
        education system struggling to keep up to date with how to best convey knowledge nowadays.</p>
      <p> The opportunity to design a vocabulary learning app came just at the right time.</p>

      <h5>Role</h5>
      <p>UX| UI designer</p>
      <h5>Tools used</h5>
      <p>Autodesk Sketchbook/ Marvel Prototype/ Usability Hub/ Adobe XD</p>
      <h5>Timeline</h5>
      <p> 2 Weeks </p>
    </div>



    <div>
      <h6>Understand The User</h6>
      <h5>Interviews</h5>
      <p>In order to understand how students approach learning a language today from both sides, I first sat down with some of my colleagues and ask them about their extensive teaching experience. This gave me some initial insights into how the
        current curriculum was structured as well as what students were struggling with based on their experience. </p>

      <p>I then went on to conduct interviews with as many students as I could fit into my schedule.</p>
      <p>I chose as my main target audience international students and refugees between the ages of 12-14 years of age since they had to learn languages not just for the purpose of succeeding academically, but also to integrate themselves into their
        new surroundings and become part of the country and culture they currently lived in. In short, their stakes were higher and the work load even bigger. They also had to retain words for longer, ideally forever and apply it in a real-life
        setting. </p>
      <p> Using the data from both the faculty as well as student interviews, I created several affinity maps and found the following insights</p>

      <h5>Key Insights</h5>
      <ul class="insights">
        <li>Long-term retention is very low for most students </li>
        <li> Students want to customize/ personalize their written notes with visual and audible content </li>
        <li>Competing among each other is a great motivator for them</li>
        <li>They like studying as a community</li>
        <li>Reviewing and spaced repetition are their main approach to studying</li>
        <li>Learning has to be fun and offer rewards </li>

      </ul>

      <p> During my interviews I tried to find out what, if any, apps students were using to assist them with learning. Although a few were mentioned, none of them satisfied their needs. So I wanted to find out why.



      <h5>Competitive Analysis & Surveys</h5>
      <p>Since there was no existing apps which satisfied my interviewees, I conducted a competitive analysis of some of the apps I was introduced to during my interviews,in addition to some other major players on the market. I wanted to see for
        myself
        what bothered my interviewees with the existing products and where they fell short. So I chose to do a SWOT Analysis of the following language learning apps:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> Memrise </li>
        <li> Quizlet </li>
        <li> Flip </li>
        <li> Flashcards </li>
        <li> Khan Academy </li>
      </ul>


      <p>After my analysis I decided that creating a flashcard app would be the best solution to the problem. This type of app gives the user the opportunity to enrich their notes with visual and auditory material and review, share and used card sets
        to compete against each other. The limited space
        of flashcards would also limit the student to choose their words precisely and add a game-like feel to learning.</p>


      <p>I decided to make a survey of about 75 students in order to determine which are some of the most popular apps among my target audience in general and to see what they expecting in terms of UI and UX to hold their attention. TikTok and
        Snapchat won by far and so I analysed its UX and UI to see how I could use the insights for my product to fullfill the users' expectations and to understand their mental models.</p>

      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/flash/website_flashsketches@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/flash/website_flashsketches@2x.png" alt="my process">
      </picture>

      <p> When comparing the existing flashcard apps on the market with apps popular among teenagers, I quickly realized that many of the flashcard apps were very outdated in terms of UI and dynamism. Having worked with teenagers at that time, I
        could
        see that those apps were not engaging or fun enough for them to want to use them to study. And the number one criteria to learn anything new for anyone is that it has to be fun and engaging. And these apps were far from it.</p>

      <h5>Personas</h5>

      <p>Based on my research I created several personas and picked Alicia as the best representation of my target audience due to her encompassing all the criteria of an ambitious, international high school student with a busy school and social
        life. Not only does she want to
        use our app to get good grades, but also to feel more connected with the country she is currently living in. If the app would life up to her expectations, it will do so with all students. </p>

        <img src="img/flash/website_flashpersona@2x.png" alt="my process">
      </picture>

      <h5>Problem Statement </h5>
      <p>With all this information at hand I decided it was time to form a problem statement to not loose sight of the initial goal:</p>
      <p> As a busy highschool student Alicia needs a way to create, store and share customizable, fun, multi-sensory flashcard-sets so that she can learn vocabulary for 4 languages in the most time-efficient way after a long day at school and get
        time off in the evening to spend balancing with her family.</p>
      <p> We will know this to be true when we see international highschool student download Flash, use it regularly and learn new languages with more ease and a better retention rate."</p>

      <h5>Hypothesis </h5>
      <p>We believe that by building a flashcard app which allows Alicia to create custom, multi-sensory card sets which she can use to review and share with her friends we will speed up her learning and retention process by 40-50%.</p>

      <h5> User Stories</h5>
      <p> To keep track of the primary and secondary features I needed to implement I created some user stories:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> As a visual learner Alicia wants a way to create custom flashcard sets so that she can easily create mental hooks and memorize the words more efficiently and for longer.</li>
        <li>As a student who spends a lot of time commuting Alicia wants a fast and easy way to review her decks so that she can use her time as efficiently as possible.</li>
        <li> As a social individual Alicia wants to be able to share her personalized notes with her classmates so that they can all save time and motivate each other.</li>
      </ul>

      <p> Since I had set myself a deadline, I chose to address the most important features first and put the remaining ones in a backlog to be addressed later on.<br> This backlog consisted of the following features:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>As a competitive student Alicia want to be able to compete with her classmates so that we can push each other and learn while having fun. </li>
        <li>As a student Alicia wants to receive rewards when she performs well so that she can feel accomplished and motivated by seeing her work is paying off.</li>
      </ul>

    <div>
      <h6>Ideation</h6>
      <h5>How might we?</h5>
      <p>Now it was time to find possible solutions. To kick off I wrote some HMW questions to get the creative juices flowing:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>How might we enable Alicia to create personalized visual notes without being an artist?</li>
        <li> How might we help Alicia learn and remember new large amounts of Vocabulary long-term?</li>
        <li>How might we enable Alicia to review Vocabulary easily and efficiently in short time intervals?</li>
        <li>How might we allow Alicia to quickly share and receive sets with friends?</li>

      </ul>

      <h5>The answer: Mnemonics</h5>
      <p>I started by doing some research into what the most efficient way to learn and retain new Vocabulary would be. After spending hours of watching videos and reading articles on the subject matter, I came across mnemonics, and how they can be
        used to acquire new Vocabulary. A lot of it overlapped with what I had
        discovered during my student interviews and so I felt that this was the way to go. </p>
      <p> Mnemonics are an ancient memory technique which uses visualization and spacial memory to help us store information. Nowadays it is widely used in memory competitions to learn entire encyclopedias by heart or remember the order of 50 decks
        of playing cards. Here an example of how it can be used to learn new Vocabulary:</p>

      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/flash/website_mnemonics@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/flash/website_mnemonics@2x.png" alt="my process">
      </picture>


      <p>Not only have mnemonics been used for centuries to store memories long-term, but they are also visual and creating them has a game-like aspect to it leaving tons of room for fun, customizable actions which is exactly what my interview
        subjects had requested. This could turn learning a language into a game like activity for students to do as a group where everyone could express themselves and show-off their creativity. </p>


      <p>
        In order to enable everyone to create custom images no matter what their degree or artistry, I next analyzed out some photo editing apps. I wanted to create an inclusive app which would allow everyone to express themselves based on their
        varying degrees of artistsic talent and create a
        personal relationship with the flashcards they were creating. Implementing various photo editing as well as drawing tools would enable everyone to create custom cards, no matter what their artistic skills.


      <h5> User Scenarios</h5>
      <p> Now that I knew in what direction my app was heading, I chose to write a possible scenarios in which Alicia would be using our product. I decided to do some storyboards to study and help clearify the circumstances under which Flash would be
        useful in a real-life context.</p>

      </picture>


      <h5>User flows</h5>
      <p>Based on my user stories, I created the user flows to figure out how my users would navigate the core features of the app in order to accomplish a task.</p>

      <h6>Wireframes</h6>

      <p> Now that I had a clear map of my IA I decided to sketch out my first set of lo-fi wireframes.<br></p>


      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/flash/website_flashlofiwires1@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

        <img src="img/flash/website_flashlofiwires3@2x.png" alt="my process">
      </picture>




      <h6> Guerrilla Usability Testing </h6>

      <p> Based on these wireframes I created a prototype using Marvel and ran some in-person usability tests in school. Although the app was overall well received there were some minor painpoints:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> Despite the existing onboarding process, some users had trouble understanding how navigate the card editor feature </li>
        <li> Some icons were unclear</li>
        <li> An option to set the language for the app at the beginning was missing</li>
        <li> The option to toggle between different views in the progress tracking section was missing</li>
        <li> Not being notified of autosave when creating a new card was causing uncertainity as to how to save work in progress</li>
      </ul>

      <h6> Final Design</h6>
      <p>Based on the feedback I receivd during testing, I made the following changes to the app:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> I added a guided task completion for first time users</li>
        <li> I reesigned some icons using A/B tests to validate my choices</li>
        <li> I added a drop-down menu a the beginning of the app where the user can pick her language</li>
        <li> I added different viewing options for the progress tracking feature</li>
        <li> I added a notification informing the user that his work is being saved while using the editor</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At this point I decided to polish the UI of my app a bit. Since I am an artist by trade I had an initial idea of what I would like the app to look like but immediately reminded myself that I have to keep my bias out of this and see what my
        students would like. I therefore decided to do some research into how other language and vocabulary learning apps approached their UI and created a styleboard.</p>

      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/flash/website_flashinspirationboard@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/flash/website_flashinspirationboard@2x.png" alt="hi-fi wires">
      </picture>

      <p>I realized that my app had to be "loud" in order to appeal to my target market, so I conducted some guerilla A/B testing during school breaks to see what visuals would appeal to my target audience more and based on that defined the style for
        Flash. As I had expected yellow won as primary color since it went hand in hand with the name of the app.</p>

      <p> Here is a selection of hi-fid wireframes:

      <h6>Learnings</h6>

      <p>The major take-aways of this experience are the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li> Don't overthink, just get started. UX being such a large an complex field, I felt quite intimidated before taking the first step. But after starting with my interviews, one thing led to another and everything gained momentum from there
          on out.</li>
        <li>Don't underestimate yourself.When I started this project I was pretty lost at first, but through researching and reading I got a pretty good idea of how to approach this project.</li>
        <li> Always be proud of your progress and celebrate the small achievements. There were many times when I got stuck and felt like this would all just be a waste of time. But when I then went back and looked at the work I had done so far, it
          re-energized me to move forward.</li>
        <li> Love who you are doing it for. Doubt about whether or not I was going down the right path sometimes creeped up, but when I then shared my work with my colleagues and students to get their feedback and them loving it, it re-energize me
          enourmously to push foward.
        <li>Last but not least, a project is never really finished. Not only am I looking forward to address the backlog of user stories I want to add to Flash, but I know already that students' needs will change and so I will have to adapt my app.
        </li>
      </ol>
